## Compilation of resources

Here's the compilation of resources I followed/ would recommend to follow- 

If u can afford, I would strongly recommend 'GO classes' coaching. Course price is 25900. It is worth it. If u take up the GO Classes, you need not follow any other material.

You can use the promo code ```'SK0RON'``` to get 4-5% discount on the course price.
